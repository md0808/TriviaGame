# TriviaGame

https://md0808.github.io/TriviaGame/

This is a fungi themed trivia game I created with javascript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML.

The game moves through a series of multiple choice questions about fungi. The user has 30 seconds to guess the correct answer before moving onto the next question. Score is tallied at the end.

This application was built by creating an object of questions, and a set of functions that analyzes the the users choices against the information in the object. The setTimer method was used to limit the period in which the user can chose the right answer.
